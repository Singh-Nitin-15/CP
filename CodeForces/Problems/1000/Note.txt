-->> Square root method
This method is used to find factors efficiently

The square root method to find factors of a number 𝑛
n is an efficient technique that reduces the number of iterations needed.

If 𝑑 is a divisor of n, then n/d is also a divisor of 𝑛
So you only need to check up to sqrt(n), not all the way to 𝑛.

📌 Steps:
1) Loop from i = 1 to sqrt(n).
2) if n%i == 0 then i is factor of n also n/i is a factor.
